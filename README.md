~ is where the dotfiles are

## Thanks ##
[Zach Holman](http://zachholman.com/) showed me the way with his [elegant approach](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles) to structuring and symlinking dotfiles.  I've pulled in tricks from [Mathias Bynens](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles), [Ryan Bates](https://github.com/ryanb/dotfiles), and [Ben Alman](https://github.com/cowboy/dotfiles).  Lastly, I've spent way too much time on [GitHub](http://github.com)'s [unofficial guide to dotfiles](http://dotfiles.github.io/).
